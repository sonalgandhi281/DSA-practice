# Ignore executables without extension (common on Linux/macOS)
# Ignore any file that has no extension but has an executable permission
# Note: Git doesn’t detect “executable permission” in .gitignore,
# so we use a pattern-based approach:
# (ignore any file in root that doesn't have an extension)
# BUT keep .cpp, .h, and folders

# Ignore all files in root without an extension
# (use carefully if you don't have extensionless source files)
